# react-tailwind-project

This project is a React + Vite + Tailwind CSS based UI for a car repair / service website.

## Project Setup

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc)

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performance.

## ESLint Configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled.
